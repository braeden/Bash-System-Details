# Bash-System-Details
# Sysinfo.sh
Outputs a large amount of system information in a nice format

# HTMLgenerator
Same as above but it creates a readable HTML file which can output to monitor a remote server by running the script with a cron task

**These are both build in bash and will only work with Unix/Linux**
