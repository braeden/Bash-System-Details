# Bash-System-Details
# Sysinfo.sh

Outputs a large amount of system information in a nice format with color

# HTMLgenerator.sh

Same as above but it creates a readable HTML file which can be used to monitor a remote server by running the script with a cron task, and outputing it to the Web Host

**These are both built in bash and will only work with Unix/Linux**
